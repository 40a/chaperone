Files in this directory were created ad-hoc by me as a sandbox testing area.  Typically, I create a docker
image and point /home to my host's /home, then keep chaperone in a sub-directory where I work on it without
needing to install it each time.   I run my docker image with ./testdock and it isolates operation in this
sandbox directory.

The "testimage" script is especially useful since it lets you work with a standard docker chaperone image
while substituting the current chaperone source instead of using the installed version.
