Chaperone Project Status
========================================================================

The Chaperone process manager is ready for public testing, and no
longer in pre-release.  It is relatively stable.

Issues for Chaperone itself should be submitted on 
the `chaperone github issues page <https://github.com/garywiz/chaperone/issues>`_

Documentation status:

* `Reference Section <ref>`_: Complete.
  Will be updated always to reflect feature changes and clarifications.
* Usage Section: In progress.  Will contain samples and best practices.
* Tools Section: Not started.  Command-line tools like ``telchap``, ``envcp``, and
  ``sdnotify`` which are bundled with Chaperone need documentation pages of
  their own.
* Appendices: Documentation for chaperone-based images (such as those at
  `chaperone-docker <http://github.com/garywiz/chaperone-docker>`_ will
  be located as appendices of the Chaperone reference.

There are several production-quality images which we are building both for
our own use, and as samples of various Chaperone use-cases.  

These are separately maintained and have their own read-me pages at
`chaperone-docker <http://github.com/garywiz/chaperone-docker>`_.

Help is always appreciated.
