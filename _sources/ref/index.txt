Chaperone Reference
===================

This is the full Chaperone Reference and describes in detail how to run and configuration Chaperone.

However, if you are using Chaperone with Docker, you can save time and see how a pre-built container works
and come back here later when you need more detail.
To get started, we suggest reading the :ref:`intro`, then try out the ``chaperone-lamp`` Docker 
image by following the instructions on the `chaperone-docker github page <https://github.com/garywiz/chaperone-docker#try-it-out>`_

Any bugs should be reported as issues at https://github.com/garywiz/chaperone/issues.
